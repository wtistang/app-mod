Argocd Introduction\nContinuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment are important devOps practices. These processes are valuable and ensures that the software is up to date timely.\n* Continuous Integration is an automation process which allows developers to integrate their work into a repository. When a developer pushes his work into the source code repository, it ensures that the software continues to work properly. It helps to enable collaborative development across the teams and also helps to identify the integration bugs sooner.\n* Continuous Delivery comes after Continuous Integration. It prepares the code for release. It automates the steps that are needed to deploy a build.\n* Continuous Deployment is the final step which succeeds Continuous Delivery. It automatically deploys the code whenever a code change is done.

However GitOps advocates applying the same principles (reviews, pull requests, tagging, etc) to infrastructure and application configuration so that teams can benefit from the same assurance as they do for the application source code.\n* Although there is no precise definition or agreed upon set of rules, the following principles are an approximation of what constitutes a GitOps practice:\n\nArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Check these guides out if you want to know more about Argo - [Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for Kubernetes](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/).\n\n### 2. Objective\n\nThe objectives of this lab are to help you:\n\n* learn how to deploy application to OCP cluster using ArgoCD UI\n* learn how to work with ArgoCD in command line\n\n### 3.\tPrerequisites\n\nThe following prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning this lab:\n*\tFamiliarity with basic Linux commands\n*\tHave internet access\n*\tHave a SkyTap App Mod Lab environment ready\n\n### 4.\tWhat is Already Completed\n\nA six Linux VMs App Mod Lab environment has been provided for this lab. \n \n  ![](images/lab-vms.png)\n\n*\tThe Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v4.6, is installed in 5 VMs, the master1 VM, the master2 VM, the master3 VM, the dns VM and the nfs VM, with 3 master nodes and 3 compute nodes (the master nodes are serving as computer nodes as well).\n*\tThe Workstation VM is the one you will use to access and work with OCP cluster in this lab.\n  The login credentials for the Workstation VM are:\n  User ID: **ibmdemo**\n  Password: **passw0rd**\n  Note: Use the Password above in the Workstation VM Terminal for sudo in the Lab.\n*\tThe CLI commands used in this lab are listed in the **Commands.txt** file located at the **/home/ibmdemo/add-mod-labs/dv0100st** directory of the Workstation VM for you to copy and paste these commands to the Terminal window during the lab.\n\n### 5.\tLab Tasks\n\nDuring this lab, you complete the following tasks:\n*\taccess ArgoCD UI\n* deploy a sample app to the OCP cluster from ArgoCD UI\n* work with the ArgoCD from command line\n\n### 6.\tExecute Lab Tasks\n\n#### 6.1 Log in to the Workstation VM and get started \n1.  If the VMs are not already started, start them by clicking the play button for the whole group.\n\n  ![](images/start-vms.png)\n\n\n2.\tAfter the VMs are started, click the Workstation VM icon to access it. \n\n  ![](images/access-workstation.png)\n\n  The Workstation Linux Desktop is displayed. You execute all the lab tasks on this workstation VM.\n\n3.\tIf requested to log in to the Workstation OS, use credentials: **ibmdemo**/**passw0rd**\n\n#### 6.2 Deploy application in ArgoCD UI\n\n##### 6.2.1 Get ArgoCD login information from the OCP cluster\nArgoCD can be install to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clsuter with ArgoCD operator or from the command line.  \n\nIn this lab environment, the ArgoCD is installled to the OCP cluster using IBM Cloud Native Toolkit. The Cloud-Native Toolkit is an open-source collection of assets that enable application development and support teams to deliver business value quickly using Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud-managed Kubernetes. This guide provides information to help Developers, Administrators, and Site Reliability Engineers use the Toolkit to support delivering business applications through the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Click the link to learn more about the [Cloud Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev).\n\nTo access the ArgoCD, you need to get its server and login credientals information.\n\n1. Open a terminal window by clicing its icon from the Desktop toolbar.\n\n  ![](images/terminal-icon.png)\n\n2. From the termical window, issue the **oc login** command to login to the OCP cluster:\n\n  ```\n  oc login https://api.demo.ibmdte.net:6443\n  ```\n\n  when promted, enter the login credientials as: **ibmadmin**/**engageibm**.\n  \n  ```\n  Authentication required for https://api.demo.ibmdte.net:6443 (openshift)\n  Username: ibmadmin\n  Password: \n  Login successful.\n\n  You have access to 66 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with ' projects'\n\n  Using project \"default\".\n  ``` \n3. Get ArgoCD username info:\n\n  ```\n  export ARGOCD_USER=$(oc get secret argocd-access -n tools -o jsonpath='{.data.ARGOCD_USER}' | base64 -d)\n  echo $ARGOCD_USER\n  ```\n4. Get ArgoCD password info:\n  ```\n  export ARGOCD_PASSWORD=$(oc get secret argocd-access -n tools -o jsonpath='{.data.ARGOCD_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d)\n  echo $ARGOCD_PASSWORD\n  ```\n5. Get AroCD server info:\n  \n  ```\n  export ARGOCD_URL=$(oc get secret argocd-access -n tools -o jsonpath='{.data.ARGOCD_URL}' | base64 -d)\n  export ARGOCD_SERVER=$(echo $ARGOCD_URL|sed -E 's/^\\s*.*:\\/\\///g')\n  echo $ARGOCD_SERVER\n  ```\n6. Write down the ArgoCD username, password and server information.  You will use them to login to the ArgoCD server from the ArgoCD UI and from the commandline.\n##### 6.2.2 Deploy app through ArgoCD UI\n1. Open a Firefox web browser window by clicking its icon on the Desktop toolbar.\n\n  ![](images/firefox-icon.png) \n2. From the browser window, click the Could Native Toolkit **Developer Dashboard** bookmark to open it.\n\n  ![](images/toolkit-bookmark.png) \n  \n3. Click **Open with OpenShift** to cotinue.\n\n  ![](images/login-with-ocp.png)\n\n4. If prompted to log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, click **htpasswd** field. Then log in with **ibmadmin**/**engageibm** as the username and password.\n \n  ![](images/ocp-console-login-1.png) \n\n  ![](images/ocp-console-login-2.png) \n\n  The IBM Cloud Native Toolkit Developer Dashboard page is displayed. \n  \n  ![](images/toolkit-page.png)\n\n4. Click the ArgoCD link to access the ArgoCD UI\n\n  ![](images/argocd-link.png) \n\n  The ArgoCD page is dispalyed.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-ui-page.png)\n\n5. Login with the username and password with the information you obtained above and click **SIGN IN**.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-ui-login.png)\n6. From the ArgoCD Home page, click **NEW APP**.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-new-app.png)\n\n7.

Initially, the app will be out of sync. It is yet to be deployed. You need to sync it for deploying.\n\n   ![](images/argocd-created.png)\n\n8. To sync the application, click **SYNC** and then click **SYNCHRONIZE**.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-sync.png)\n\n  Once the sync is done, the deployment process gets started. Wait till the app is deployed.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-processing.png)\n\n9. Once the app is deployed, click on it to see the details.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-app-ready.png)\n\n10. In the **APPLICATION DETAILS** page, click each deployment block to view its detail information.\n\n  ![](images/argocd-view-deployment.png)\n\n##### 6.2.3 Verify the deployment\nAccess the app to verify if it is correctly deployed.\n\n1. Go back to the terminal window, list the **cloudnativesampleapp-service** route with command.\n\n  ```\n  oc get route -n default\n  ```\n  \n  It should have a hostname under **HOST/PORT** column\n\n  ```\n  NAME                 HOST/PORT                                         PATH   SERVICES                       PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD\n  cloudnative-sample   cloudnative-sample-default.apps.demo.ibmdte.net          cloudnativesampleapp-service   9080                 None\n  ```\n\n2. Set an environment variable **APP_URL** using the **HOST/PORT**.\n\n  ```\n  export APP_URL=\"http://$(oc get route cloudnative-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')\"\n  echo ARGOCD_SERVER=$APP_URL\n  ```\n  \n  The output is:\n\n  ```\n  ARGOCD_SERVER=http://cloudnative-sample-default.apps.demo.ibmdte.net\n  ```\n  \n3. Access the app url using curl:\n\n  ```\n  curl \"$APP_URL/greeting?name=Carlos\"\n  ```\n  \n  The output is:\n  \n  ```\n  {\"id\":2,\"content\":\"Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!!
