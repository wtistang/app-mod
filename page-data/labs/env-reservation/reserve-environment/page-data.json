IBM Transformation Advisor and WebSphere Automation have been installed as operators in the cluster.\n*\tThe Workstation VM is the one you will use to access and work with OCP cluster in this workshop. The workstation is pre-configured with lab artifacts, WebSphere Application Servers, Liberty Collective and developer tools, including:\n    * Docker\n    * VSCode\n    * SDK 8.0.5\n    * WAS 8.5.5\n    * WAS 9.0.5\n    * Liberty Collective \n    * IBM Cloud CLI \n    * Node \n    * IBM Garage for Cloud CLI \n    * Tekton CLI Cloud \n    * Native ToolKit \n    * ArgoCD CLI \n    * Knative CLI\n    * Hey CLI \n\n  The login credentials for the Workstation VM are:\n  * User ID: **ibmdemo**\n  * Password: **passw0rd**\n  \n**Note:** The **Workstation** VM is the VM the user will login to and use in the lab.\n\n![](./images/access-workstation.png)\n\nIt is recommended to use Chrome or Firefox browser to work with the lab workstation.\n\n**Note:** If the Skytap Cloud environment resources approach capacity limits, you may experience delays in **stating** the environment. If this occurs, you will see **rate limited** messages. Not to worry, the environment will start, but just be delayed while the system is busy. Under certain circumstances, it may take up to **20 minutes** for the environment to start.\n\nNow you are ready to use the specific lab guides to do demos or self-enablement. \n\nThe labs are available from the **Navigation** pane on the left side of the page. \n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"feaba70a7f7a4bbd0798d7cfd1c1bd7c","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":8307},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab Environment Reservation"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab Environment Reservation\n---\n\n## Reserve a Single Environment for Demos or Self-Enablement\n\n![](./images/demo.png)\n\nA Skytap lab environment is provided for the labs/demos in this asset.\n\nEnvironment reservations are immediate and can be reserved for up to two weeks in duration. \n\nUse the instructions below to reserve your demo/lab environment. \n\n### 1.\tMake a Reservation for Workshop Lab Environment \n\nWorkshop Lab Environment reservation is available for IBMer's and Business Partners.
