You decide to use the IBM Transformation Advisor to do a quick evaluation of these applications without their source code to identify a good candidate application to move to cloud based on the analysis result.\n\n### 2.\tObjective\nThe objectives of this lab are to:\n*\tlearn how to collect Java application and configuration data using the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool. \n*\tlearn how to use the Transformation Advisor to evaluate the move to cloud efforts and to identify the good candidate for migration.\n\n### 3.\tPrerequisites\nThe following prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning this lab:\n*\tFamiliarity with basic Linux commands\n*\tHave internet access\n*\tHave completed SU0100 of this lab series and have the CP4Apps installed in IBM Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (OCP) cluster on IBM Cloud.\n\n### 4.\tWhat is Already Completed\nA six Linux VMs App Mod Lab environment has been provided for this lab. \n \n  ![](images/lab-vms.png)\n\n*\tThe Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v4.6, is installed in 5 VMs, the master1 VM, the master2 VM, the master3 VM, the dns VM and the nfs VM, with 3 master nodes and 3 compute nodes (the master nodes are serving as computer nodes as well).\n*\tThe Workstation VM is the one you will use to access and work with OCP cluster in this lab.\n  The login credentials for the Workstation VM are:\n  User ID: **ibmdemo**\n  Password: **passw0rd**\n  Note: Use the Password above in the Workstation VM Terminal for sudo in the Lab.\n*\tThe CLI commands used in this lab are listed in the **Commands.txt** file located at the **/home/ibmdemo/add-mod-labs/am0100st** directory of the Workstation VM for you to copy and paste these commands to the Terminal window during the lab.\n\n### 5.\tLab Tasks\nIn this lab, you access WebSphere Application Server to review the deployment of the JEE applications. Then you are going to the Transformation Advisor to identify a good candidate application for moving to cloud. To identify which Java EE programming models are on the server, you could run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the server. The Transformation Advisor creates an inventory of the content and structure of each application and learn about problems that might occur if you move the application to cloud. Finally, you review the analysis reports to determine the complexity of the move-to-cloud efforts and select the migration candidate app.\n\nHere are the activities involved in this process:\n*\tLog in to WebSphere Application Server to review the deployed JEE applications\n*\tRun the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the WebSphere Application Server to get application data\n*\tReview the analysis reports that Transformation Advisor generates to identify the right candidate application for a rapid and cost-effective migration to cloud\n\n### 6.\tExecute Lab Tasks\n\n#### 6.1\tLog in to the Workstation VM and Get Started \n1. If the VMs are not already started, start them by clicking the play button for the whole group.\n\n  ![](images/start-vms.png)\n\n2.\tAfter the VMs are started, click the Workstation VM icon to access it. \n\n  ![](images/access-workstation.png)\n\n  The Workstation Linux Desktop is displayed.

You are going to identify one of them to be the god candidate to move the cloud later.\n\n1.\tStart WebSphere Application Server\n\n    In the Workstation VM, you have a local WebSphere Application Server which hosts several sample applications. \n    To start the WAS server:\n    \n    a. Open a terminal window by clicking its icon on the Desktop toolbar.\n    \n    ![](images/terminal-icon.png)\n\n    \n    b. In the terminal window, issue the command below to start the WAS server (You can copy and paste the command from the Commands.txt file in the **/home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/am0100** directory).\n\n    ```\n    /home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/shared/startWAS.sh\n    ```\n\n    Within a few minutes the WAS server is ready.\n\n    c.\tAccess the WAS Admin Console to view the application deployed by clicking the Firefox icon on the Desktop toolbar.\n    \n    ![](images/firefox-icon.png)\n \n    d.\tFrom the web browser window and click WebSphere Integrated Solution Console bookmark to launch the WAS console.\n\n    ![](images/was-bookmark.png)\n \n    e.\tIn the WAS Admin Console login page, enter the User ID and Password as: **wsadmin**/**passw0rd** and click **Login**.\n\n    f.\tOn the WAS Console page, click **Applications** -> **Application Types** -> **WebSphere enterprise applications** to view the apps deployed.\n\n    ![](images/was-enterprise-apps.png)\n \n    In the Enterprise Applications list, you can see all applications deployed. Next, you use Transformation Advisor to analyze these applications to identify a good candidate to be moved to the cloud.\n\n#### 6.3\tAccess Transformation Advisor\n\nThe Transformation Advisor is installed in the OCP cluster.  In this lab, you use the following steps to access it.\n\n1. From web browser window, click the **IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor** bookmark and log in with the OCP account credentials.\n\n    ![](images/ta-bookmarked.png)\n \t\n2. If prompted to log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, click **htpasswd** field. Then log in with **ibmadmin**/**engageibm** as the username and password.\n \n    ![](images/ocp-console-login-1.png) \n\n    ![](images/ocp-console-login-2.png) \n    \n    The Transformation Advisor Home page is displayed.\n \n    ![](images/ta-home-page.png)\n\n#### 6.4\tDownload Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility\n\nThe Transformation Advisor can evaluate any Java based applications. In this lab, you are going to use it to evaluate whether the on-premises WebSphere application, Mod Resorts, is suitable to move to cloud and what the effort might be to get it there. You can use Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility to get the application data from the WebSphere Application Server running on the Workstation VM. The utility can be downloaded from the Transformation Advisor web page.\n\n1. In the Transformation Advisor page, you first create a new workspace by entering the workspace name as **Evaluation** and then clicking **Next**.\n \n   ![](images/ta-new-workspace.png)\n    Note: A workspace is a designated area that houses the migration recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor against your application server environment. You can name and organize these however you want, whether it’s by business application, location or teams. \n\n2. Enter the collection name as **Server1** and click **Let’s go**.\n \n    ![](images/ta-new-collection.png)\n    Note: Each workspace can be divided into collections for more focused assessment and planning. Like workspaces, collections can be named and organized in whatever way you want.\n\n3. Once the Workspace and Collection are created, you have options to either download the Data Collector utility or upload existing data file. In this lab, you are going to use the Data Collector utility. Click **Data Collector** to go to the download page.\n\n    ![](images/ta-data-collector.png)\n4. In the Download page, you can download different version of the utility based on your source operating system.  It also shows how to use the utility in command line to collect application data from WebSphere, WebLogic and Tomcat servers. Since the lab VM is a Linux OS, click Download Linux to get the utility.\n  \n    ![](images/ta-download-dc.png)\n5. In the Download dialog window, select the Save File option and click OK.\n \n    ![](images/ta-save-dc.png)\n\n    The zipped Data Collector utility file is saved in /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory of the lab desktop.\n\n#### 6.5\tRun Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility \n\nAfter downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, you need to unpack it and run the utility against the WAS server to collect all deployed applications and their configuration data from WAS server.\n\n1. Go back to the terminal window.\n\n2. In the terminal window, navigate the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory and view its contents with commands:\n\n    ```\n    cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/\n    ls -l\n    ```\n\n    You see the downloaded data collector utility file saved in the directory.\n\n3. Extract the data collector utility with commands:\n\n    ```\n    tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation_Server1.tgz\n    ``` \n\n The data collector utility is extracted to /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/transformationadvisor-2.3.4 directory.\n\n4. Execute the Data Collector utility with the commands below to start collect the deployed applications information on the WAS server.\n\n    ```\n    cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/transformationadvisor-2.3.4\n    ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /home/ibmdemo/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 wsadmin passw0rd\n    ```\n5. Type **1** to accept the license agreement and press Enter. \n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-license-agreement.png)\n\n    The utility starts to collect application data.\n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-running.png)\n\n    This process takes sometimes to complete depending on how many applications deployed on the WAS server.  In this lab, it might be a few minutes. When it is done, you see a message **Thank you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis**.\n\n    Your application data is collected, it is saved as a zip file under the tool directory as shown below.\n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-output.png)\n\n    In general, if your application server and the Transformation Advisor are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data is automatically uploaded to Transformation Advisor for you to view the analysis results.  Otherwise, you have to manually upload the data to Transformation Advisor before you can view them. \n\n#### 6.6\tEvaluate On-Premises Java Applications\n\nIn this section, you are going to use the Transformation Advisor UI to view the application data analysis results. \n\n1. Go back to Transformation Advisor page in web browser, click the **Server1** link to the Recommendations page.\n\n    ![](images/ta-server1-link.png)\n\n    In the Recommendations page, you can see all applications deployed to the WAS server are listed. \n\n    ![](images/ta-recommendation-page.png)\n    On the Recommendations page, the identified migration source environment is shown in the Profile section, and the target environment is shown in the Preferred migration section. The data collector tool detects that the source environment is your WebSphere Application Server ND AppSrv01 profile. The target environment is **Compatible Liberty Runtime**, which is the default target environment.\n\n    The Recommendations page also shows the summary analysis results for all the apps in the AppSrv01 environment to be moved to a Liberty on OpenShift environment. For each app, you can see these results:\n\n    * Name\n    * Complexity level\n    * Dependencies\n    * Issues\n    * Estimated development cost in days\n\n    For example, if you want to move the **modresorts-1_0_war.ear** application to Liberty on OpenShift, the complexity level is Simple, which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to cloud. The application has no dependency, has one minor level issue and the estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required.\n\n    As you can see the default move to cloud environment is **Compatible Liberty Runtime**, however Transformation Advisor can also provide migration options if you want to migrate your application to different target environments as shown below:\n\n    ![](images/ta-target-environments.png)\n\n    In this lab you are focusing on identifying a good candidate for moving to the Liberty on OpenShift environment, so the default target environment is good. \n\n    If you look at the complexities of these applications, you can see that the **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** (Mod Resorts application) and **pbw-ear.ear** (PlansByWebSphere application) has the simple complexity, which mean that these two applications can be migrated to cloud without any code change.  But since the **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** application has lesser issue (1) than the **pbw-ear.ear** application (4), so you should look at the analysis results for **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** application in detail first.\n\n2. Click the **modresorts-1_0_war.ear** link to expand its analysis results.\n \n    ![](images/ta-modresorts-app-link.png)\n\n    The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity section. The overall complexity for the application is simple, indicating that the application can be directly moved to cloud without any code change. \n \n    ![](images/ta-complexity.png)\n\n3. Scroll down to Application Details section. You can see although there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 5 days. This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating management, server configuration, and testing. \n\n    ![](images/ta-app-details.png) \n4.\tContinue to scroll down to the Issues section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container.\n \n    ![](images/ta-additional-info.png)\n5.\tNext, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the **Technology Report** link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. \n  \n    ![](images/ta-tech-report-link.png)\n    The report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS.  It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application.\n\n    ![](images/ta-tech-report.png) \n    As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere platforms.\n\n6. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the **Analysis Report** link.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report-link.png)\n    \n    a. Click **OK** to continue.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report-ok.png)\n \n    Now you see the Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report.png) \n    This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level.\n    \n    b. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules.\n\n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules.png) \n    For the Mod Resorts application, there is one warning rule regarding the application configuration in Docker containers.\n    \n    c. Click the **Show results** link.\n\n    You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is or potential issue may be.\n \n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules-2.png)\n    \n    d. Click the **Show rule help** link.\n\n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules-3.png) \n    \n    This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue.\n \n    ![](images/ta-rule-help.png)\n\n    For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container.\n\n7. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the **Inventory Report** link.\n    \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report-link.png)\n\n    The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application that tend to accumulate over time. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. \n \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report.png)\n\n    a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them.\n \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report-2.png)\n    From the analysis reports you looked at above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Compatible Liberty Runtime which is the target environment, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for moving to liberty on cloud in the repackage process with minimum effort.\n    \n8. Now you know that the Mod Resorts application can be moved to Liberty on cloud, you want to know if it is also a good candidate for re-platform with WAS on cloud. To do that switch the target environment from **Compatible Liberty Runtime** to **WebSphere traditional**.\n\n    ![](images/ta-twas-base-on-openshift.png)\n \n    As you can see from the TA recommendation that the Mod Resorts application is also a good candidate for re-hosting in WAS Base container on cloud.  If you want to review the recommendation details, you can follow the same steps you did before to go over them.\n \n9. Evaluate the PlantsByWebSphere Application (Optional).\n\n    You can follow the same procedure you did for the Mod Resorts application to view the analysis results for the PlantsByWebSphere application.\n  \n    As you can see from the Summary list, the recommendations for the application to move to cloud are as follows: \n\n    * The complexity level is Simple, which means that the application code can be deployed to Liberty on OpenShift without any changes. \n    * The application has 3 dependencies and 6 minor issues. \n    * The estimated development effort is 0 day because no code changes are needed.\n\n#### 6.7 View the Mod Resorts application\n\nFrom the analysis you did above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is a good candidate for moving to cloud, you can view how the application looks like.\n\n1. From the web browser window, click new Tab to open a new browser window. Type the Mod Resorts application URL: **http://localhost:9080/resorts/** and press **Enter**.\n\n    The Mod Resorts application home page is displayed.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-home-page.png)\n\n2. Click **WHERE TO?** dropdown menu to see the city list.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-where-to.png)\n \n3. Click **PARIS, FRANCE** from the list, it shows the weather of the city.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-paris.png)    \n    Now you have reviewed the application, our next step is to move this application to cloud.  Please go to the Part 2 of the lab series (Lab - AM0200) to learn how to re-platform the application to Liberty on cloud or to the Part 3 of the lab series (Lab - AM0300) to learn how to re-host it for WAS container in cloud.\n\n### 7.

In this lab, you are going to use the Data Collector utility. Click **Data Collector** to go to the download page.\n\n    ![](images/ta-data-collector.png)\n4. In the Download page, you can download different version of the utility based on your source operating system.  It also shows how to use the utility in command line to collect application data from WebSphere, WebLogic and Tomcat servers. Since the lab VM is a Linux OS, click Download Linux to get the utility.\n  \n    ![](images/ta-download-dc.png)\n5. In the Download dialog window, select the Save File option and click OK.\n \n    ![](images/ta-save-dc.png)\n\n    The zipped Data Collector utility file is saved in /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory of the lab desktop.\n\n#### 6.5\tRun Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility \n\nAfter downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, you need to unpack it and run the utility against the WAS server to collect all deployed applications and their configuration data from WAS server.\n\n1. Go back to the terminal window.\n\n2. In the terminal window, navigate the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory and view its contents with commands:\n\n    ```\n    cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/\n    ls -l\n    ```\n\n    You see the downloaded data collector utility file saved in the directory.\n\n3. Extract the data collector utility with commands:\n\n    ```\n    tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation_Server1.tgz\n    ``` \n\n The data collector utility is extracted to /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/transformationadvisor-2.3.4 directory.\n\n4. Execute the Data Collector utility with the commands below to start collect the deployed applications information on the WAS server.\n\n    ```\n    cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/transformationadvisor-2.3.4\n    ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /home/ibmdemo/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 wsadmin passw0rd\n    ```\n5. Type **1** to accept the license agreement and press Enter. \n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-license-agreement.png)\n\n    The utility starts to collect application data.\n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-running.png)\n\n    This process takes sometimes to complete depending on how many applications deployed on the WAS server.  In this lab, it might be a few minutes. When it is done, you see a message **Thank you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis**.\n\n    Your application data is collected, it is saved as a zip file under the tool directory as shown below.\n \n    ![](images/ta-dc-output.png)\n\n    In general, if your application server and the Transformation Advisor are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data is automatically uploaded to Transformation Advisor for you to view the analysis results.  Otherwise, you have to manually upload the data to Transformation Advisor before you can view them. \n\n#### 6.6\tEvaluate On-Premises Java Applications\n\nIn this section, you are going to use the Transformation Advisor UI to view the application data analysis results. \n\n1. Go back to Transformation Advisor page in web browser, click the **Server1** link to the Recommendations page.\n\n    ![](images/ta-server1-link.png)\n\n    In the Recommendations page, you can see all applications deployed to the WAS server are listed. \n\n    ![](images/ta-recommendation-page.png)\n    On the Recommendations page, the identified migration source environment is shown in the Profile section, and the target environment is shown in the Preferred migration section. The data collector tool detects that the source environment is your WebSphere Application Server ND AppSrv01 profile. The target environment is **Compatible Liberty Runtime**, which is the default target environment.\n\n    The Recommendations page also shows the summary analysis results for all the apps in the AppSrv01 environment to be moved to a Liberty on OpenShift environment. For each app, you can see these results:\n\n    * Name\n    * Complexity level\n    * Dependencies\n    * Issues\n    * Estimated development cost in days\n\n    For example, if you want to move the **modresorts-1_0_war.ear** application to Liberty on OpenShift, the complexity level is Simple, which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to cloud. The application has no dependency, has one minor level issue and the estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required.\n\n    As you can see the default move to cloud environment is **Compatible Liberty Runtime**, however Transformation Advisor can also provide migration options if you want to migrate your application to different target environments as shown below:\n\n    ![](images/ta-target-environments.png)\n\n    In this lab you are focusing on identifying a good candidate for moving to the Liberty on OpenShift environment, so the default target environment is good. \n\n    If you look at the complexities of these applications, you can see that the **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** (Mod Resorts application) and **pbw-ear.ear** (PlansByWebSphere application) has the simple complexity, which mean that these two applications can be migrated to cloud without any code change.  But since the **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** application has lesser issue (1) than the **pbw-ear.ear** application (4), so you should look at the analysis results for **moderesorts-1.0_war.ear** application in detail first.\n\n2. Click the **modresorts-1_0_war.ear** link to expand its analysis results.\n \n    ![](images/ta-modresorts-app-link.png)\n\n    The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity section. The overall complexity for the application is simple, indicating that the application can be directly moved to cloud without any code change. \n \n    ![](images/ta-complexity.png)\n\n3. Scroll down to Application Details section. You can see although there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 5 days. This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating management, server configuration, and testing. \n\n    ![](images/ta-app-details.png) \n4.\tContinue to scroll down to the Issues section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container.\n \n    ![](images/ta-additional-info.png)\n5.\tNext, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the **Technology Report** link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. \n  \n    ![](images/ta-tech-report-link.png)\n    The report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS.  It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application.\n\n    ![](images/ta-tech-report.png) \n    As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere platforms.\n\n6. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the **Analysis Report** link.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report-link.png)\n    \n    a. Click **OK** to continue.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report-ok.png)\n \n    Now you see the Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window.\n\n    ![](images/ta-analysis-report.png) \n    This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level.\n    \n    b. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules.\n\n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules.png) \n    For the Mod Resorts application, there is one warning rule regarding the application configuration in Docker containers.\n    \n    c. Click the **Show results** link.\n\n    You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is or potential issue may be.\n \n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules-2.png)\n    \n    d. Click the **Show rule help** link.\n\n    ![](images/ta-warning-rules-3.png) \n    \n    This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue.\n \n    ![](images/ta-rule-help.png)\n\n    For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container.\n\n7. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the **Inventory Report** link.\n    \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report-link.png)\n\n    The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application that tend to accumulate over time. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. \n \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report.png)\n\n    a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them.\n \n    ![](images/ta-inventory-report-2.png)\n    From the analysis reports you looked at above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Compatible Liberty Runtime which is the target environment, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for moving to liberty on cloud in the repackage process with minimum effort.\n    \n8. Now you know that the Mod Resorts application can be moved to Liberty on cloud, you want to know if it is also a good candidate for re-platform with WAS on cloud. To do that switch the target environment from **Compatible Liberty Runtime** to **WebSphere traditional**.\n\n    ![](images/ta-twas-base-on-openshift.png)\n \n    As you can see from the TA recommendation that the Mod Resorts application is also a good candidate for re-hosting in WAS Base container on cloud.  If you want to review the recommendation details, you can follow the same steps you did before to go over them.\n \n9. Evaluate the PlantsByWebSphere Application (Optional).\n\n    You can follow the same procedure you did for the Mod Resorts application to view the analysis results for the PlantsByWebSphere application.\n  \n    As you can see from the Summary list, the recommendations for the application to move to cloud are as follows: \n\n    * The complexity level is Simple, which means that the application code can be deployed to Liberty on OpenShift without any changes. \n    * The application has 3 dependencies and 6 minor issues. \n    * The estimated development effort is 0 day because no code changes are needed.\n\n#### 6.7 View the Mod Resorts application\n\nFrom the analysis you did above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is a good candidate for moving to cloud, you can view how the application looks like.\n\n1. From the web browser window, click new Tab to open a new browser window. Type the Mod Resorts application URL: **http://localhost:9080/resorts/** and press **Enter**.\n\n    The Mod Resorts application home page is displayed.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-home-page.png)\n\n2. Click **WHERE TO?** dropdown menu to see the city list.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-where-to.png)\n \n3. Click **PARIS, FRANCE** from the list, it shows the weather of the city.\n\n    ![](images/mod-resorts-app-paris.png)    \n    Now you have reviewed the application, our next step is to move this application to cloud.  Please go to the Part 2 of the lab series (Lab - AM0200) to learn how to re-platform the application to Liberty on cloud or to the Part 3 of the lab series (Lab - AM0300) to learn how to re-host it for WAS container in cloud.\n\n### 7. Summary\n\nIn this lab, you learned how to evaluate the existing Java application using IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor. As a part of IBM Application Modernization solutions, the Transformation Advisor tool provides a recommendation for the right-fit IBM WebSphere Application Server edition and offers advice, best practices and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or to WAS container, or to newer versions of WebSphere traditional. It accelerates application migrating to cloud process, minimize errors and risks and reduce time to market.
