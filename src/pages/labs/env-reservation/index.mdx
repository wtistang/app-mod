## About Environment Reservations and Workshops

The **App Mod, DevOps and Day 2 Operation Workshop** asset includes customer facing hands on use case driven labs for containerization, OpenShift, WebSphere Application Modernization, Devops Modernization, and Application Management Modernization. 

The material can be used in a variety of ways: 

  * Demos for Customers 
  * Self enablement for IBMers and Business Partners
  * Customer Facing Workshops 
  
When using this asset for running demos or self-enablement, use the **Reserve Single Environment** option to reserve a single environment. 
  
When hosting a customer workshop, use the **Create Workshop** to request multiple environments for a specific date and time.
  
**TIPS:** 
  
  * Workshops must be requested at least 72 hours prior to the start of a workshop.  
  * Single Environment reservations create an environment **NOW** and are provisioned immediately, if desired, and can be kept for up to two weeks.
