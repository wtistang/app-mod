description: 
---

In this Lab, you walk through the process using the Liberty Readiness Analysis to evaluate the existing WebSphere applications. 

The Liberty Readiness Analysis tool is included in the Cloud Pak for Applications (CP4Apps), it is an integrated tool in the Admin Console of the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) version 9.0.0.11 and above. This tool simplifies the process to evaluate your existing WebSphere applications for moving to WebSphere Liberty in your application modernization journey.

Liberty Readiness Analysis assess the readiness of your enterprise applications for WebSphere Liberty. It answers the following common questions about the Application Modernization Journey:
*	How ready are the applications in my admin console for running in Liberty?
*	Which applications can I move now and which will need to be refactored?
*	Will it be easy or problematic to prepare my applications for Liberty?
*	What resources and time will I need to invest to modernize them?
*	Which applications running my WAS administrative console are ready for Liberty?
*	Will it be easy or hard to prepare my applications for Liberty?
*	Which applications should I refactor first?
*	What resources and time will I need to invest to modernize them?

Liberty Readiness Analysis is a dynamic first step on the application modernization journey, it
*	Leverage the traditional WAS Admin Console to scan your applications and report their readiness to move to WebSphere Liberty
*	Low-touch way to determine “Easy” or “Hard” work to prepare applications for Liberty
*	Exposes users to Liberty and Migration Tools in a user interface they already know
*	Assist planning and prioritization in moving applications to a Cloud-ready, highly composable, fast to start, dynamic application server runtime, WebSphere Liberty.

Liberty Readiness Analysis enables traditional WAS administrators and developers to analyze their deployed applications from within the administrative console and get a report with the issues, warnings, and best practices for moving them to WebSphere Liberty.

It indicates that if you want to migrate the application to Liberty server, you face two severe issues and one warning.

#### 6.6	Review the evaluation reports 

In this task, you review the evaluation reports you created in the task above and learn more details about the migration assessment.

1.	Look at the report for the **query** application first.  

    a. Click the **query** application Report link in the Liberty Report section.
 
    ![](images/query-report-link.png)

    The Application Migration Report is displayed.
 
    The report consists of three sections, including
    *	Technology Evaluation Summary - indicates which IBM Platforms are a good fit with the technologies used by the application.
    *	Migration Rule Severity Summary - shows how many rules were flagged and the number of times each was encountered.
    *	Application Migration Details - is divided into four sections: 1).	Technology Evaluation - provides a table of the technologies detected and matching IBM platforms. Technologies that are not supported are linked to analysis rules listed in the Detailed Migration Analysis section. 2).	Detailed Migration Analysis - where all the flagged rules are listed along with rule specific help information. It even identifies the file names and line numbers where the rule infractions were detected. 3).	Inventory - provides a high-level view of the content and structure of the application. 4). Liberty Feature List - contains a list of all the required features for the application in the Liberty server.xml configuration file.

    b.	View the Technology Evaluation Summary.

    The Technology Evaluation Summary shows which editions of WebSphere Application Server are best suited to run the selected application. it provides a list of Java EE programming models that are used by the application, and it indicates on which platforms the application can be supported.
 
    ![](images/tech-evaluation-summary.png)

    As you can see from the summary table, the query application is not supported by Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud and Liberty Core platforms.

    c.	Click the vertical scroll bar on the right to go to the Migration Rule Severity Summary section and review it.

    The Migration Rule Severity Summary lists all issues, their severity levels, migration rules used and their descriptions. 
 
    ![](images/rule-severity-summary.png)

    In the summary report, two severe level issues and one warning level issue are identified.  Their detail analysis report can be found in the Detailed Migration Analysis section of the report. Jump links are available in the LABEL column for accessing the detailed info.

    ![](images/app-migration-details.png)

    e. Review the Technology Evaluation section.

    The section lists all the Java programming models that the application uses and whether those models are supported by a specific WebSphere platform. This information is used to determine whether a WebSphere product is suitable for the application to migrate to.
 
    ![](images/app-migration-details-2.png)

    
    The scanner identifies that the query application uses EJB, which is not supported on Liberty Core platform.  The application also uses Remote EJBs, which are not supported on both Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud and Liberty Core platforms. 

    f. Scroll to the Detailed Migration Analysis section and review it

    This section shows all the issues that were found at the code level in a specific class file and specific line. You can see the Java technology issues that were identified based on different migration rules. 
 
    ![](images/detail-migration-analysis.png)
    
    As shown in the report, three migration rules are flagged, and four results are identified regarding to the Remote EJB and the EJB Query API as well as the EJB blinding locations. This information helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is. The report also provides Rule Help to assist developers to work around the issue.

    g. Scroll down to review the severe rule number 2.
 
    ![](images/rule-help.png)

    h.	Scroll down to review the Additional Rule Help section.
 
    ![](images/additional-rule-help.png)

    This section list different java technologies contained in the application archive package.

    m.	Scroll down to the end of the report to review the Liberty Feature List.
    
    ![](images/liberty-feature-list.png)
    
    The Liberty Feature List contains the application required Liberty features which should be included in the Liberty server.xml configuration file.
 
    After reviewing the query application analysis report, we know that significant development effort is required if we want to move this application to Liberty server, therefore it is not a good migration candidate. 

    m.	 Scroll up and click Back to close the report.
 
    ![](images/report-back.png)

2.	Now you look at the report for the **PlantsByWebSphere** application.

    b. Click **Jump To Section** -> **Technology Evaluation** to go to the Application Migration Details/Technology Evaluation section.
 
    ![](images/jump-to-section.png)

    The section lists three Java programming models that the application uses, and all those models are supported by the IBM WebSphere platforms. This means the application is suitable for migrating to Liberty.
 
    c. Scroll down to review the other sections and you see that there is no issues and problems identified, which indicating that the application is a good candidate to be moved to Liberty.

    ![](images/app-migration-details-2.png)
    
    d. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to review the Liberty Feature List.  The scanner has determined that four Liberty features are used to support the application runtime, including cdi-1.0, jsf-2.0, jsp-2.2 and servlet-3.0.
 
    ![](images/liberty-feature-list-2.png)

3. Scroll up to the top of the report and click **Back**.

#### 6.7	Delete the evaluation report 

The evaluation reports created by the tool can be deleted by selecting one or more applications from the enterprise applications collection. Additionally, when applications are uninstalled or redeployed, the migration reports for those application automatically get deleted. This is done to avoid there being a mismatch between the information contained in a migration report and the version of the application that is available in the admin console. 

1.	Check the box next to the **PlantsByWebSphere** application to select it.

    ![](images/checkbox-pbw.png)

### 7. Summary

In this lab, you have learned the Liberty Readiness Analysis, a new add-on feature to WAS version 9.0.0.11 and how to use it to evaluate existing WebSphere workloads for moving to cloud right inside the WAS Admin Console.

For applications that have a green checkmark and are ready for Liberty, go ahead and try running them on either [Open Liberty[(http://openliberty.io/) or [WebSphere Liberty](http://wasdev.net/). Alternatively, you can use [Transformation Advisor](http://ibm.biz/CloudTA) to start planning the migration of the applications to WebSphere Liberty, moving them into containers, and even deploying to either IBM Cloud or OpenShift. Transformation Advisor helps by generating some of the necessary artifacts such as Liberty server.xml file with a features list and some migrated configuration information, Docker files for containerization, as well as OpenShift operator and deployment YAML for Kubernetes deployment.

For applications that need to be updated before moving to Liberty and you have the source code available, add the [WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit](http://ibm.biz/WAMT4Eclipse) to your Eclipse development environment. This toolkit analyzes application source code and generates the same report as Liberty Readiness Analysis but from within your Eclipse IDE so that changes can be made quickly and easily. WebSphere Liberty can be run directly from within the Eclipse IDE too, making it all that much easier to verify that your application runs as expected.

As a part of IBM application Modernization solutions in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications, Liberty Readiness Analysis enables traditional WAS administrators and developers to analyze their deployed applications from within the administrative console and get a report with the issues, warnings, and best practices for moving them to WebSphere Liberty.
