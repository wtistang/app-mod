title: Deploy a Java App to OCP using the Open Liberty Operator
description: 
---

One of the solutions included in the **Cloud Pak for Applications** is the Open Liberty runtime, a highly composable, fast to start, dynamic application server runtime environment for cloud-native Java microservices.

This lab exercise is a part of the Application Modernization lab series which focus on the evaluation, re-platforming and re-hosting application modernization approaches and other application modernization related solutions. In this lab, you learn another re-platform option - deploying an existing Java application to an Open Liberty container running on an IBM Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (OCP) cluster in IBM Cloud using the Open Liberty Operator. 

An Operator is an extension to Kubernetes which implements a custom controller for packaging, deployment and management of a Kubernetes application in OCP. The Open Liberty Operator deploys and manages a Java EE/MicroProfile/Spring application running on Open Liberty in a OCP cluster.

### 1.	Business Scenario

Assume that your company has a web application called Mod Resorts, depicted in the image below, a WebSphere application showing the weather in various locations. Your company wants to move this application from an on-premises standalone deployment to a cloud capable deployment.

![](images/mod-resorts-app-home-page.png) 

As a tech lead, you have already analyzed the application using the IBM Transformation Advisor tool. Based on the analysis you know that you can move this application from the traditional WebSphere Server environment to a light-weighted Open Liberty server environment without any code change (The Transformation Advisor analysis steps are covered in the lab 1 of this lab series!). Now you are planning to deploy this application to an Open Liberty instance running on an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster. In this lab, you are going to implement this solution. The Mod Resorts application is currently deployed on-premises in the local WebSphere Application Server (WAS). You create an Open Liberty Docker image with the Mod Resorts application and deploy the Docker container to OpenShift Kubernetes cluster using the Open Liberty Operator.

### 2.	Objective

The objectives of this lab are to:
*	Obtain some knowledge of the Open Liberty Operator
*	Learn how to create an Open Liberty Docker image

    Now that you have reviewed the application, next you learn how the solution included in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications helps to move this application to the cloud.

    d. Go back to the Terminal window and issue the command below to stop the WAS server.

    ```
    /home/ibmdemo/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin/stopServer.sh server1
    ````

### 6.3	Install the Open Liberty Operator

In OCP, the Kubernetes-native applications are deployed on Kubernetes cluster and managed with the Kubernetes APIs and OCP specific API’s. A Kubernetes Operator is a custom controller in OCP, which packages, deploys and manages a Kubernetes-native application, and eases operational complexity. The Open Liberty Operator is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator, which deploys and manages a Java EE/MicroProfile/Spring application running on Open Liberty in OCP. 

The Open Liberty Operator can be used to deploy and manage applications running on Open Liberty. You can also perform Day-2 operations such as gathering traces and dumps using the operator. 

The operator provides the following key features:
*	Routing - expose your application to external users via a single toggle.
*	High Availability - run multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.
*	Persistence - enable persistence for your application by specifying storage requirements.
*	Serviceability - easily use a single storage for serviceability related operations, such as gathering server traces or dumps.
*	Service Binding - easily bind to available services in your cluster.
*	Knative - deploy your serverless application on Knative using a single toggle.

The architecture of the Open Liberty Operator follows the basic controller pattern: the Operator container with the controller is deployed into a Pod and listens for incoming resources with a Kind: OpenLibertyApplication. The operator introduces relies on an OpenLibertyApplication custom resource definition (CRD). Then applying an OpenLibertyApplication custom resource (CR) triggers the Open Liberty Operator to create, update or delete Kubernetes resources needed by the application to run on your cluster.

In this lab, you use the following steps to install the Open Liberty Operator from the OCP Operator Hub.

1.	From the browser window, click the OCP cluster Web Console bookmark to open it with your IBM credentials.
 
    ![](images/ocp-console-bookmarked.png)
2.	In the OpenShift Web Console page, click **Operators**>**OperatorHub**.

    ![](images/ocp-operators-operatorhub.png) 
3.	The OperatorHub page is displayed, change Project to openshift-operator.

    ![](images/openshift-operator-project.png) 
4.	Enter liberty in the Filter field.

    ![](images/operatorhub-page.png) 
5.	Click **Open Liberty Operator** icon to install it.

    ![](images/search-for-open-liberty.png) 
6.	Click **Install** to start the process.

    ![](images/open-liberty-operator-install.png) 
7.	In the next page, click **Subscribe**.

    ![](images/open-liberty-operator-subscribe.png) 

    The Open Liberty Operator is now installed, and the Custom Resource Definitions used by the operator are deployed.

    In order to deploy an Open Liberty application to a OCP cluster with the Open Liberty Operator, you need:
    *	An Open Liberty Image
    *	An Open Liberty Operator CR

#### 6.4	Build an Open Liberty Docker Image.

The IBM Cloud Pak for Applications has a tool called Transformation Advisor, which can be used to analyze your existing java applications and evaluate the efforts to move them to cloud. The analysis of the Mod Resorts application is covered in lab AM0100 of this lab series. The analysis report shows that the Mod Resorts application can be directly moved the Open Liberty server in a Docker container without any code change. In this task, you are going to build an Open Liberty Docker image containing the Mod Resorts application. 
The Dockerfile is the key file you needed to build your Docker image. It defines how the Docker image that has the Mod Resorts application and configuration pre-loaded is built.

1.	Review the Dockerfile file.

    a. From the Desktop toolbar, click the File Manager icon to open it.
    
    
    ![](images/vm-files-link.png)
    b. Navigate to **/home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/am0210/appmod-resorts/** directory.

    ![](images/docker-file.png)
    c. Double click the dockerfile to open it in the Text editor for reviewing.
    
    ![](images/docker-file-content.png)
    
    As you can see, the file defines the following activities to create the Open Liberty Docker image:
    *	Pulls the Open Liberty Java EE 8 image from Docker Hub
    *	Adds the application binary file to the base image
    *	Adds the Open Liberty server.xml file to the base image

    Note: the server.xml file is the Open Liberty server configuration file. In this lab, a sample server.xml is used, it contains the default Open Liberty server settings meet all the Mod Resorts application needs.
 
2.	Build the Docker image.

    a. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands in the Terminal window:

    ```
    cd /home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/am0210/appmod-resorts/
    docker build . -t app-modernization:v1.0.0
    ```
    
    The command above combines what is normally two steps in the image build process:
    *	Building the Docker image
    *	Tagging the image with a name that is consistent with OCP cluster registry requirements

    b. After the docker container image is created, you can issue the command below to check it:
    
    ```
    docker images | grep app-modernization
    ```
    c. To verify the docker image, you can create and run a local container called **modresorts-loc** with the command below:
    
    ```
    docker run --name modsorts-loc -p 9443:9443 -d app-modernization:v1.0.0
    ```

    d. Once the container is created, you can test the Mod Resorts application by launching it in a web browser window with the URL: https://localhost:9443/resorts.

#### 6.5	Push the Open Liberty Docker Image to OCP cluster Image Registry

After the Open Liberty Docker image is built, you need to push it to the OpenShift cluster image registry, so you can use it to deploy the Open Liberty container to OCP cluster.

1.  From the browser window, go back to the OCP cluster Web Console page.

2.	In the OpenShift Web Console page, click the **Action** icon next to your username and select **Copy Login** Command to get the OCP login command.

  ![](images/ocp-copy-login-command.png) 
3.	In the next page, click **Display Token** link.

  ![](images/display-token.png) 
4.	Copy the OCP login command to the clipboard.

  ![](images/copy-token.png) 
5.	Go back to the Terminal window, right-click to paste the OCP login command window press Enter to log in to the OCP cluster.
 
  ![](images/run-oc-login-command.png) 
6. Create new OpenShift project (namespace) called **demo** to host your applications.

    ```
    oc new-project demo
    ```
7.	Get OCP internal image registry URL and cluster URL with commands:

  ```
  export INTERNAL_REG_HOST=`oc get route default-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n openshift-image-registry`
  export CLUSTER_URL=`echo $INTERNAL_REG_HOST | sed 's/default-route-openshift-image-registry.//g'`
  ```
8.	Log in to the OpenShift Docker registry with the command in the Terminal window:
    
    ```
    docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $INTERNAL_REG_HOST
    ```
8. Execute the following command to push your docker image to OpenShift image repository.

    ```
    docker tag app-modernization:v1.0.0 $INTERNAL_REG_HOST/`oc project -q`/app-modernization:v1.0.0
    docker push $INTERNAL_REG_HOST/`oc project -q`/app-modernization:v1.0.0
    ```
    
    When it is done, your application docker image is pushed to the OCP image registry.

10.	Verify the pushed Docker image in OCP cluster.

    a.	From the OCP Web Console Home page, click **Builds**>**Images Streams**.
  
   ![](images/ocp-builds-is.png) 
   
    b.	Change the **Project** from **default** to **demo**.
   
   ![](images/ocp-demo-project.png) 

    c.	You can see the image you just pushed is listed. Click its link to view its details.
 
   ![](images/ocp-demo-is.png) 

    In the Image Stream Details Page Overview section, you see the public image repository you used to push the image.  Notice that the public image repository is mapped to an internal image repository which is used to deploy the application.  The internal image repository is: **image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/demo/app-modernization**.
 
   ![](images/ocp-is-overview.png) 
 
#### 6.6	Deploy the Open Liberty Container to OCP using the Open Liberty Operator

In this task, you are going to deploy the Open Liberty container to the OCP cluster using the Open Liberty operator CR. The operator provides an easy way to quickly provision an Open Liberty container in an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster environment.

1.	Review the Open Liberty operator CR YAML file. From the File Manager navigate to **/home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/am02100/appmod-resorts/deploy/apps/appmod/v1.0.0/**  directory. Double click the **app-mod_cr.yaml** to open it in Text editor for reviewing.

    ![](images/app-mod-cr.png)

    This CR file contains the minimum required spec entries for application deployment. The CR file specifies that it is using the Open Liberty Operator CRD (OpenLibertyApplication) with an application image URL.

    For more information about the configuration parameters in the OpenLibertyApplication CR, please visit: https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md.

2.	Deploy the Open Liberty container.

    Use the following OpenShift CLI commands to deploy the Open Liberty container:

    ```
    cd /home/ibmdemo/app-mod-labs/am0210/appmod-resorts/
    oc apply -f deploy/apps/appmod/v1.0.0/app-mod_cr.yaml -n demo
    ```

    The Open Liberty container is deployed to OpenShift Kubernetes cluster demo namespace by the Open Liberty Operator.

    As you can see in the verification section next, although you just have the application image URL specified in the CR file, the Open Liberty Operator takes care of application deployment process and creates the Kubernetes service for the application automatically.

#### 6.7	Verify the Open Liberty Container Deployment

After the Open Liberty container is deployed, you can go to the OCP console to take a look at the deployment details.

1.	Go back to the OCP cluster Web Console window, select **Workloads**>**Pods**, then selection demo project.
    
    ![](images/ocp-workloads-pods-demo.png)
    You can see that your application is in list and it is running.

    ![](images/ocp-demo-app-running.png)
2.	To view the application service, from the OCP cluster Web Console navigation menu, select **Networking**>**Services**. You see the application service is created by the Open Liberty Operator.

    ![](images/ocp-demo-service.png)
3.	To access the application URL, you need to create a route with the application service resource. from the OCP cluster Web Console navigation menu, select **Networking**>**Routes** and click **Create Route**.

    ![](images/ocp-create-route.png)

4.	In the Create Route page, enter the following values and click Create.

    **Name** = appmod
    
    **Path** = /resorts

    **Service** = appmod

    **Target** = 9080

    **Hostname** = appmod.&ltCLUSTER_URL&gt
    
    Where  &ltCLUSTER_URL&gt is the **CLUSTER_URL** variable you created before, you can get its value with command:
    
    ```
    echo $CLUSTER_URL
    ```

    ![](images/ocp-create-route-details.png)

5.	The route is created, click the **Location* URL to launch the application from a new browser window.

    ![](images/ocp-new-route-url.png)
 
 6.	The Mod Resorts application home page is displayed. Click **WHERE TO?** to view city list.
 
7.	Click **LAS VEGAS, USA** from the list and it shows the weather of the city.
